# Parking-in-C
A parking simulation, written in C

April 2019 Update: 
This is a parking simulation written in C.
It outputs alot of simulation data to a file.
It can also output animation data, later read by a Processing script, not present here. 

This entire project needs a lot of refactoring, and is currently
not well structured, although it WORKS perfectly alright.

No work is being done on this currently, and likely never will.
